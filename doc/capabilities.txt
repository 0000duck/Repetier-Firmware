Capabilities detection
----------------------

While it is nice if a firmware supports some special features, it would be
even better if hosts would detect that these are available so they
start using them. Especially with the wild growth of firmware forks and
versions, no host can know which variant can handle what. So at least
for Repetier-Firmware we introduce with version 1.0 a new simple protocol
to tell hosts what features are available, so they can activate them.

To make it easy to detect, a standard M115 report gets now extended by
one or more lines, each line telling what capability. These lines have the
following format:
Cap:<NameOfCapability>:<0 or 1>

Notice: no spaces allowed, Name is upper case with underline to separate words.
Lines MUST start with "Cap:" so it can be parsed very quickly by hosts.

The last value indicates if that capability is supported or not. The simple
absence of a message is not enough since it would be possible, that the
firmware simply does not report capabilities at all and host has to make
assumptions like showing eeprom editor even with the risk that it is not
available. Whereas a 0 value shows that a function is known, but the
functionality is not implemented/active.

Knowing different developers will add other capabilities is no real problem
as long as all names differ, so hosts can distinguish them by name. Hosts
not understanding a name simply ignore them.

Currently defined capabilities:

Cap:EEPROM

Defines if firmware is compiled with eeprom support.

Cap:AUTOREPORT_TEMP

Defines if firmware can automatically report temperatures. This feature
needs to be enabled by M155 S1 so older hosts do not get double responses
from own M105 requests and auto report feature.

Cap:PROGRESS

Firmware supports the progress protocol:
- M530 S<printing> L<layer> - Enables explicit printing mode (S1) or disables it (S0). L can set layer count
- M531 filename - Define filename being printed
- M532 X<percent> L<curLayer> - update current print state progress (X=0..100) and layer L

This allows a host to enable a special information mode on LCD display, so that
users see progress in percent, model being printed and layer being printer and
total layer. Hosts can also use M117 to send time remaining to status line.

This feature should onely be enabled if a lcd is available to show it, otherwise
the extra commands are useless.

Cap:AUTOLEVEL

Firmware supports autoleveling.

Cap:Z_PROBE

Firmware supports z probing.

Cap:SOFTWARE_POWER

Supports enabling/disabling power with M80/M81

Cap:TOGGLE_LIGHTS

Supports toggling lights on/off with M355.
